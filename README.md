# Calculator
Calculator project

Simple calculator emulator in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Testing framework is Mocha, Chai and Sinon.

Main focus of this project was to pull together HTML,CSS and Javascript comfortably. I used it as an oppurtunity to start getting to grips with Classes, Exception Handling and Unit Testing.
