# Calculator

Simple calculator emulator in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Testing framework is Mocha, Chai and Sinon.

Main focus of this project was to pull together HTML,CSS and Javascript comfortably. I used it as an opportunity to start getting to grips with Classes, Exception Handling and Unit Testing.
