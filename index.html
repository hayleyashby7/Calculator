    2) USER INPUT
    User will input an operator (+,-,*,/) and 2 integers and then selects correct function above based on operator. 

    3) INTERFACE
    Need a simple layout:
    0-9+-*/= and clear buttons
    Display

    4) DISPLAY FUNCTION
    Populate display when number buttons clicked - keep track of displayValue variable for future use

    5) BRING TO LIFE
    When user clicks button, update display. 
    Flow:
    User clicks firstNumber
    User clicks operator
    User clicks secondNumber
    Use operator to decide which function to call and then send the first and second number as arguments.
        return calculatedValue from operation

    *REPEAT AS NEEDED
    (Previous calculatedValue is first number - Update display to show calculatedValue
    User clicks operator
    User clicks secondNumber
    Use operator to decide which function to call and then send the calculatedValue and second number as arguments.)
    END REPEAT*

    User clicks =  
        Display final total
